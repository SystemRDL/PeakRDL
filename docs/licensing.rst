Licensing
=========

Re-distribution of the PeakRDL command line interface tool shall adhere to the
terms outlined by the GNU LGPL v3 license. For a copy of the license, see:
https://github.com/SystemRDL/PeakRDL/blob/main/LICENSE


Why LGPL?
---------
LGPL was chosen because my intent is to promote a thriving ecosystem of free and
open source register automation tools. LGPL discourages this tool to be directly
embedded into commercially sold closed-source software, as that would be
contrary to this project's philosophy.


What is covered by the LGPL v3 license?
---------------------------------------
The LGPL license is intended for the command line tool itself. This includes all
Python sources and testcase infrastructure not explicitly mentioned in the
exemptions below.

Many of the PeakRDL sub-commands are implemented as separate plugins which are
licensed individually.


What is exempt from the LGPL v3 license?
----------------------------------------
Don't worry. Not everything that the PeakRDL project touches is considered
LGPL v3 code.

The following are exempt and are free to use with no restrictions:

*   Any output generated by PeakRDL's core commands is yours to use freely with no restrictions.
*   Any code snippets in this documentation can be freely copy/pasted. These are
    examples that are intended for this purpose.
*   All example files available in the `examples folder in the repository <https://github.com/SystemRDL/PeakRDL/tree/main/examples>`_


How are plugins licensed?
-------------------------
Every PeakRDL plugin is licensed separately. If you write your own plugin, you
can use any license you would like. Of course I would encourage you to use
LGPL v3 as well!


Can I use this as part of my company's internally developed tools?
------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely!

Sometimes it may be necessary to integrate this into a larger toolchain at your
workplace. This is totally OK, as long as you don't start distributing it
outside your workplace in ways that violate the LGPL v3 license.
